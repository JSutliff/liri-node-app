# Liri-Node-Bot

LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. Given a command from the list
LIRI will perform an associated task. Tasks LIRI can accomplish are: returning event information 
for your favorite band, querying spotify for information relating a song, or retrieving 
movie information based on a title. 

## Getting Started

In order to use LIRI you must have Node installed. Download/Clone the repository to
to your own machine and run a Node install from your package manager. I have listed the dependencies 
below. 

### Prerequisites
Your machine mush have a recent version of Node installed with NPM.
You will need to make a .env file with your own API keys for twitter and spotify.


### Installing

Initialize your .env file with your api keys for Spotify. Your .env file should look like this:

```
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID='---spotify ID----'
SPOTIFY_SECRET='---spotify Secret---'

```
